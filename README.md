# DermoscopicSegmentation
Local Attribute Segmentation of pigmented skin lesion images

This project constitutes my bachelor thesis, carried out during the first semester of 2021. 

It is framed in the ISIC 2018 Challenge, a public challenge that took place in 2018 and is available here: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2018

A modified ad hoc version of ISIC DB 2018 was used in order to evaluate the proposal. The original version of the dataset is available here: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data
