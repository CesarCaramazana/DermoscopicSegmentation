# Dermoscopic Imaging Semantic Segmentation
Local Attribute Segmentation of pigmented skin lesion images.

*This project constitutes a bachelor thesis in Sound and Image Engineering, carried out during the first semester of 2021*. 

It is framed in the ISIC 2018 Challenge, a public challenge that took place in 2018 and is available here: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2018

A modified ad hoc version of ISIC DB 2017 was used in order to evaluate the proposal, which was stored in my personal Google Drive account and mounted in the notebook. The original version of the dataset is available here: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data 



We propose a Fully Convolutional U-net like model with emphasis on the preprocessing of the images and the feature extraction path, that performs multiclass semantic segmentation in order to localize the local structures of a pigmented skin lesion. These structures are: milia-like cysts, pigment networks, negative networks, streaks and globules.
